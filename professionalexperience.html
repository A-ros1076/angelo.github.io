									Northstar Photonics, a company with fewer than 50 employees creating cutting-edge technology, 
									has provided me with an incredible internship experience thus far (as of 7/1/24). 
									Being their first intern and the youngest by more than two decades, I initially felt quite nervous.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									I joined NSP as a supply chain procurement intern, in my first week I was immersed in the field of photonics, working on a new project with numerous moving parts. During this time, 
									I gained extensive knowledge and was deeply involved in creating bills of materials, workflow charts, planning project schedules
									and facilitating communication across all departments, it felt amazing to actually contribute to something using the exact skills
									I had been learning in the previous semester! 
								</p>
								
								<p>
									I was able to sit in on executive meetings with my manager, observing how high level managers plan, track and execute, this was invaluable
									and has been one of the biggest learning experiences to date. The dedication to communication, relationship building, leadership and curiosity was exemplified
									in every meeting I attended, highlighting how vital these skills are across all industries.
								</p>


								<p>
									I learn something new everyday, whether it's presenting to the CEO/COO on a project or identifying and solving issues 
									with vendors to maintain production schedules, this experience has provided me with knowledge that is not obtainable in the classroom and I am greatful everyday to be apart
									of such a fun, innovative and creative company.

									During my Spring 2024 semester, I took BUS4 110b (Fundamentals of MIS) with Professor Timothy Hill. Initially, the class focused heavily on Python and Pandas, which I didn't particularly enjoy. While I understand the concepts and can code decently, I prefer a mix of solitary work and team interaction over coding all day.
									In the first half of the class, I didn't interact much with Professor Hill, only answering questions occasionally. However, one day, I decided to talk to him after class, and that conversation changed everything. Motivated by his quirky anecdotes and genuine personality, I began excelling in his class. I started attending his office hours regularly, seeking advice on projects and interview prep.
									During one of our conversations, Professor Hill told me about a role as a Salesforce Lab Assistant in the MIS department, which was perfect timing as many previous assistants were leaving. I accepted the role and was tasked with auditing six combined labs, each with over 100 steps. Over the summer, I meticulously ensured all directions were clear and straightforward for non-MIS students learning Salesforce.
									I continue to work in this position, enjoying the opportunity to support non-techy students in learning a new skill while gaining valuable experience with Salesforce.

									Teaspoon, so much to say and so little time, so I'll keep this short.
									I came into this role without any prior formal management experience, having been out of the workforce since 2019 to focus on my business. I thought I knew how to be a great manager and leader, but I quickly realized I had a lot to learn.
									Learning the ins and outs of running a store, keeping the team professional yet happy, and being the person whoâ€™s supposed to know everything was one of the hardest but most rewarding experiences I've had. I came in fresh and had to navigate what it really means to be a leader, doing things I didn't want to but had to. It was tough, but I prevailed.
									Meeting amazing mentors, friends, and colleagues made this experience even more worthwhile and set me up for where I am now. While I know I don't want to return to retail management, I recognize that this role helped me develop invaluable leadership, mentorship, and project management skills.
									This experience grew me as a person, tested my limits, and showed me how capable I really am. I will forever be grateful for this opportunity (shout out to the best DM, if she sees this!).

									<!-- Working at Mill was also a pleasure. Mill was founded by ex-Google employees so it was extremely insightful talking to them
									about why they decided to leave and start their own company. It was refreshing to see the passion and spark in someone's eyes 
									when they were talking about something they were truly passionate about. I also hit it off with the people behind Mill (was even offered
									a technician role), but during this point of my life, I decided to step away from technician work and really focus in on taking 
									the CS courses offered by community college. Within one semester, I had filled out the CS minor requirements by taking intro to CS, 
									data structures and algorithms, discrete math, and calculus. That summer after the semester had ended is when I started working at Jabil. Despite 
									the offer, it was at this point where I had decided where my future career goals would lie. -->
