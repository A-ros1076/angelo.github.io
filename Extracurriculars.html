									In the spring 2024 semester, I decided to join the Latino Business Student Association. 
									Initially nervous because I didn't know anyone in the club, I was pleasantly surprised by how welcoming everyone was. 
									While I've always been busy with my side businesses and other aspects of life, 
									I realized the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone to make friends and build meaningful relationships.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									Joining LBSA has been one of the best decisions I've made since transferring to SJSU. 
									Although I joined late in the semester and couldn't attend all the events, 
									I made sure to participate in as many as possible. Through LBSA, I've had incredible opportunities to visit different companies, 
									meet industry professionals, and connect with students from neighboring LBSA programs. 
									It's been a meaningful experience getting more in touch with my fellow Latino brothers and sisters.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									I encourage everyone, regardless of ethnicity, to join! It's a fantastic way to expand your network, 
									gain valuable insights, and build lasting friendships.
								</p>

								MISA was the first club I joined after transferring to SJSU in the fall of 2023. However, 
								during my first semester, I didn't attend as much as I would have liked. 
								Adjusting to a new school, moving away from my hometown, and living independently for the first time all contributed to a bit of culture shock.  
								</p> 

								<p> 
								In Spring 2024, I decided to fully engage with MISA by attending their company tours and career workshops. 
								These experiences were instrumental in enhancing my interviewing skills, 
								refining my resume formatting, and gaining insights from informative presentations by industry professionals and leaders. 
								MISA has proven to be a vital club at SJSU for MIS students, offering opportunities to build practical skills directly applicable in the real world. 
								This active participation not only helped me overcome initial challenges but also 
								significantly contributed to my personal and professional growth at SJSU.

								<p> 
								Since I was young, I've always had a passion for hands-on projects. 
								From building computers to modifying remote control planes, cars, and boats, 
								I've enjoyed fixing and tinkering with anything I could get my hands on.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									Growing up, my dad, an automotive mechanic, taught me the ins and outs of car maintenance from a very young age. 
									I often found myself holding the flashlight while he worked on carsâ€”a classic father-son bonding experience that shaped my early years.
							
								</p>

								<p> 
									Coming from a modest background, I learned to excel at fixing things we already had, thanks to my dad's guidance. 
									As our financial situation improved, my interest shifted to modifying Japanese and German cars. 
									I developed a deep passion for fine-tuning, troubleshooting, and maximizing performance.	
								</p>
								
								<p>
									Ultimately, I made the tough decision to sell my modified cars to fund my education and pursue a degree that would enable me to afford the cars and parts I dreamed of. However, 
									my love for automotive didn't stop when I sold my BMW and other cars. I continued to assist neighbors, 
									friends, and anyone in need with vehicle maintenance. 
									To this day, I volunteer my time helping people who may feel intimidated or taken advantage of by dealership services. 
									It's incredibly rewarding to share my knowledge and skills, working on a variety of vehicles and making a positive impact in my community.\
