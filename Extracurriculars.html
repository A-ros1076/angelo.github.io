									In the spring 2024 semester, I decided to join the Latino Business Student Association. 
									Initially nervous because I didn't know anyone in the club, I was pleasantly surprised by how welcoming everyone was. 
									While I've always been busy with my side businesses and other aspects of life, 
									I realized the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone to make friends and build meaningful relationships.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									Joining LBSA has been one of the best decisions I've made since transferring to SJSU. 
									Although I joined late in the semester and couldn't attend all the events, 
									I made sure to participate in as many as possible. Through LBSA, I've had incredible opportunities to visit different companies, 
									meet industry professionals, and connect with students from neighboring LBSA programs. 
									It's been a meaningful experience getting more in touch with my fellow Latino brothers and sisters.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									I encourage everyone, regardless of ethnicity, to join! It's a fantastic way to expand your network, 
									gain valuable insights, and build lasting friendships.
								</p>

								MISA was the first club I joined after transferring to SJSU in the fall of 2023. However, 
								during my first semester, I didn't attend as much as I would have liked. 
								Adjusting to a new school, moving away from my hometown, and living independently for the first time all contributed to a bit of culture shock.  
								</p> 

								<p> 
								In Spring 2024, I decided to fully engage with MISA by attending their company tours and career workshops. 
								These experiences were instrumental in enhancing my interviewing skills, 
								refining my resume formatting, and gaining insights from informative presentations by industry professionals and leaders. 
								MISA has proven to be a vital club at SJSU for MIS students, offering opportunities to build practical skills directly applicable in the real world. 
								This active participation not only helped me overcome initial challenges but also 
								significantly contributed to my personal and professional growth at SJSU.

									<!-- Over the course of fall to winter 2021, I had the opportunity to work as a contract manufacturing technician for 
									two start-ups. This coupled with the reunion of my old friend had sparked some passion for me to get industry experience. 
									I first started doing contract work at Ultima Genomics, where I was also surrounded by talented and young engineers. I was a sponge,
									absorbing all the knowledge I could of their words of wisdom. This is where I learned how to think on your feet, make 
									quick but effective decisions, and operate within an extremely fast paced environment.  -->

									<!-- Working at Mill was also a pleasure. Mill was founded by ex-Google employees so it was extremely insightful talking to them
									about why they decided to leave and start their own company. It was refreshing to see the passion and spark in someone's eyes 
									when they were talking about something they were truly passionate about. I also hit it off with the people behind Mill (was even offered
									a technician role), but during this point of my life, I decided to step away from technician work and really focus in on taking 
									the CS courses offered by community college. Within one semester, I had filled out the CS minor requirements by taking intro to CS, 
									data structures and algorithms, discrete math, and calculus. That summer after the semester had ended is when I started working at Jabil. Despite 
									the offer, it was at this point where I had decided where my future career goals would lie. -->
