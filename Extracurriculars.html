									Northstar Photonics, a company with fewer than 50 employees creating cutting-edge technology, 
									has provided me with an incredible internship experience thus far (as of 7/1/24). 
									Being their first intern and the youngest by more than two decades, I initially felt quite nervous.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									I joined NSP as a supply chain procurement intern, in my first week I was immersed in the field of photonics, working on a new project with numerous moving parts. During this time, 
									I gained extensive knowledge and was deeply involved in creating bills of materials, workflow charts, planning project schedules
									and facilitating communication across all departments, it felt amazing to actually contribute to something using the exact skills
									I had been learning in the previous semester! 
								</p>
								
								<p>
									I was able to sit in on executive meetings with my manager, observing how high level managers plan, track and execute, this was invaluable
									and has been one of the biggest learning experiences to date. The dedication to communication, relationship building, leadership and curiosity was exemplified
									in every meeting I attended, highlighting how vital these skills are across all industries.
								</p>


								<p>
									While my internship is only half way completed, I learn something new everyday. Wheater it's presenting to the CEO/COO on a project or identifying and solving issues 
									with vendors to maintain production schedules, this experience has provided me with knowledge that is not obtainable in the classroom and I am greatful everyday to be apart
									of such a fun, innovative and creative company.

									 Working at Jabil really opened my eyes to the field of software development and how to navigate a large company 
									structure. I was brought on board a bit later than the rest of the intern cohort, but here is where I learned to be a 
									self-starter and to do things on my own. This is the attitude I carried with my to Cisco and why I took on the stretch assignments 
									that I did.

									<!-- Over the course of fall to winter 2021, I had the opportunity to work as a contract manufacturing technician for 
									two start-ups. This coupled with the reunion of my old friend had sparked some passion for me to get industry experience. 
									I first started doing contract work at Ultima Genomics, where I was also surrounded by talented and young engineers. I was a sponge,
									absorbing all the knowledge I could of their words of wisdom. This is where I learned how to think on your feet, make 
									quick but effective decisions, and operate within an extremely fast paced environment.  -->

									<!-- Working at Mill was also a pleasure. Mill was founded by ex-Google employees so it was extremely insightful talking to them
									about why they decided to leave and start their own company. It was refreshing to see the passion and spark in someone's eyes 
									when they were talking about something they were truly passionate about. I also hit it off with the people behind Mill (was even offered
									a technician role), but during this point of my life, I decided to step away from technician work and really focus in on taking 
									the CS courses offered by community college. Within one semester, I had filled out the CS minor requirements by taking intro to CS, 
									data structures and algorithms, discrete math, and calculus. That summer after the semester had ended is when I started working at Jabil. Despite 
									the offer, it was at this point where I had decided where my future career goals would lie. -->
